While at HSE University, I have developed and taught graduate courses on research methods in social sciences, qualitative methods, and [computational social science](https://github.com/lisasivak/computational-social-science-course). 
I have also taught a graduate course on research methods at the Moscow School for Social and Economic Sciences. 
In 2021 I have also co-organized the first Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in Russia ([SICSS HSE](https://sicss.io/2021/hse/)).
