I am a sociologist and a computational social scientist. Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/), where I study the predictability of fertility. I am co-organizing a data challenge for predicting fertility outcomes in the Netherlands (PreFer), see details on our website [preferdatachallenge.nl](https://preferdatachallenge.nl).
